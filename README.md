Ether Bank - Ethereum smart contract


 Ether Bank is an Ethereum contract that gives users the ability to safely and securely store ether on the blockchain (like a wallet existing on the blockchain).

This contract also has security interface methods for connecting a bank account to a different owner address (wallet account - normal or contract). This is useful in case your local wallet / keys (stored on PC, mobile, usb or a piece of paper) is lost, stolen or destroyed as you will be able to recover you ether funds in full using the contract.
